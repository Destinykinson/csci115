# csci115 mini project

I was originally going to add some JavaScript and some other things but I didn't think I'd have time, which is why there's a js file, some CSS that isn't currently being used, and a form that I left as a comment in case I do add it back later on.

I have 1 actual comment aside from the form I took out, a nav bar, and some flexbox.
